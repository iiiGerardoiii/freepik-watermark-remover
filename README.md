* Step 4: Run (play) the action, it's gonna stop with a message telling you to adjust the pattern, choose STOP and double click this thing on the layers: <img width="40" height="30" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f309977-99c7-4eaa-b4fa-fdd74b20a792" /> and adjust the pattern so the logo rests perfectly over the watermarks, then click OK.

* Step 5: On the Actions tab, hit play to resume the action.

* Step 6: The watermarks should be selected, it's up to you to choose to delete them with Content-Aware Fill, or with Generative Fill, I usually choose Content-Aware because it's faster, but if it doesn't look right, try with Generative.
